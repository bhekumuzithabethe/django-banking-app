User's or clients can view their account transactions,account balance and account number. Clients can make withdrawalls using their card number and the account the client wants to withdraw money from. Transferes can only be made if a user has multiple bank accounts with us, if a client wishes to send money to a beneficiary they can make use of the pay tab to pay an account registered in our database. Clients are also able to make deposits given an account number they wish to deposit into.
