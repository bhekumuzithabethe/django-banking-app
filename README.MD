Consultants can only be registerd or created by the bank manager, and the bank manager is able to do everything the bank consultant can do.

User's or clients can view their account transactions,account balance and account number. Clients can make withdrawalls using their card number and the account the client wants to withdraw money from. Transferes can only be made if a user has multiple bank accounts with us, if a client wishes to send or transfere money to someone they can make use of the pay tab to pay an account registered in our database/bank. Clients are also able to make deposits given an account number they wish to deposit into. And this is not a real bank it is just the software part of a banking system I have developed.

You can create a client, then a bank account on the bank manager's portal. Once you are a client you can register your user account on the login page, but you firstly need to make sure you are a client , even if you don't have an account bt atleast be our client because you will have to authenticate your identity number,first name, last name and your email address. If you are not a client you won't be able to the authenticated to create your user account. Once authenticated you'll be promted to enter you first and last name once again, your username,email and password to create your user account. <br>
As the bank manager you can create a bank consultant, this is optional as the bank manager can do all the functions done bt a consultant.
